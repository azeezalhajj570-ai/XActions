# Third-party notices

XActions is Apache-2.0. This file records every outside project whose code or
design shaped part of this repository, what was taken, and under which licence.
It exists for two reasons: Apache-2.0 obliges us to keep upstream attribution
with adapted code, and a project that borrows well should say so.

Nothing here is vendored: no third-party source tree is copied into this
repository. The entries below are either small adaptations written into our own
modules, or designs we reimplemented from scratch.

## What we may take, and from whom

Our licence choice constrains what can be copied in. The rule is simple and
non-negotiable:

| Upstream licence | What we may do |
|---|---|
| MIT, BSD, ISC, Apache-2.0, Unlicense, CC0 | **Adapt the code**, keeping the upstream copyright line and licence in the file that carries it, and add a row below |
| GPL, LGPL, AGPL, SSPL, MPL | **Ideas only.** Read it, understand the mechanism, write our own. Never paste a line, never a derivative file |
| CC-BY-SA and other share-alike | **Ideas only**, same as copyleft |
| No LICENSE file at all | **Ideas only.** No licence means no grant, whatever the README says |

Two practical notes. Facts are not expression: an endpoint path, a query ID, a
header name, or a rate-limit number can be recorded from any source, because
those are observations of X's behaviour rather than someone's creative work.
And an interface is not an implementation: reading a project's public API to
match a shape is fine everywhere on this table.

When in doubt, add the dependency instead of copying it, or write it yourself.

## Code adapted into XActions

| Upstream | Licence | What we adapted | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| [d60/twikit](https://github.com/d60/twikit) | MIT | GraphQL endpoint table, feature-flag defaults, and v1.1 REST paths, since verified and refreshed against x.com's own bundles | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/endpoints.js`, `src/client/api/graphqlQueries.js` |
| [the-convocation/twitter-scraper](https://github.com/the-convocation/twitter-scraper) | MIT | The public guest bearer token and parts of the media and timeline parsing shapes | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/endpoints.js`, `src/scrapers/twitter/http/media.js` |
| [nirholas/xeepy](https://github.com/nirholas/xeepy) | Apache-2.0 (same author) | Tool behaviours ported from the Python twin | `src/mcp/server.js` |
| [Lqm1/x-client-transaction-id](https://github.com/Lqm1/x-client-transaction-id) | MIT (Copyright 2025 Lami) | The `x-client-transaction-id` algorithm: key-byte index extraction from the `ondemand.s` chunk, the cubic-bezier animation key, and the SHA-256 plus XOR payload assembly. Ported to plain regex reads so no DOM library is pulled in, and to the chunk resolver query-ID discovery already has. Verified byte-identical against the upstream package | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/transactionId.js` |

## Designs reimplemented, no code taken

| Upstream | Licence | The idea we took | Our implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [vladkens/twscrape](https://github.com/vladkens/twscrape) | MIT | An account pool that leases the least-recently-used session and parks one until its rate-limit window resets | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/accountPool.js` |
| [ihuzaifashoukat/x-use](https://github.com/ihuzaifashoukat/x-use) | MIT | Holding every write as a draft for human approval, and daily per-account action caps that survive a restart | `src/mcp/drafts.js`, `src/mcp/action-caps.js` |
| [xdevplatform/xmcp](https://github.com/xdevplatform/xmcp) | No LICENSE file, ideas only | Trimming a large tool list with an allowlist so a client's context is not flooded | `src/mcp/tool-groups.js` |
| [steipete/bird](https://github.com/steipete/bird) | Ideas only | Refreshing GraphQL query IDs from x.com's own JavaScript bundles rather than pinning them | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/queryIds.js` |
| [Altimis/Scweet](https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet) | MIT | Saving a cursor per run so an interrupted scrape resumes where it stopped | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/checkpoint.js` |
| Stripe and GitHub webhook conventions | Documentation | Signing `<timestamp>.<body>` so a captured delivery cannot be replayed | `src/notifications/webhook.js` |
| [fa0311/x-client-transaction-id-pair-dict](https://github.com/fa0311/x-client-transaction-id-pair-dict) | MIT | Publishing known-good `{animationKey, verification}` pairs so a cold start can sign a request without parsing x.com's bundles. We read the published dictionary at runtime and vendor none of it | `src/scrapers/twitter/http/transactionId.js` |
| [d60/twikit](https://github.com/d60/twikit) | MIT | The live_pipeline session shape: one long-lived event connection, a session id handed back in the first frame, and mid-session subscription changes keyed by that id. Endpoint paths, topic strings and frame keys are observations of x.com, verified against the live service; the client, its normalised events, backoff and fallback are ours | `src/streaming/livePipeline.js` |

## Deliberately not copied

These solve problems we care about, and their licences do not allow their code
in an Apache-2.0 project. Where we want the capability, we write our own.

| Upstream | Licence | Why it is ideas-only for us |
|---|---|---|
| [mikf/gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) | GPL-2.0 | Copyleft. Its media coverage is a benchmark to match, not a source to copy |
| [alkihis/twitter-archive-reader](https://github.com/alkihis/twitter-archive-reader) | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | Share-alike. Our archive importer was written from the file format, not from its code |
| [gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app) | AGPL-3.0 | Strong copyleft. Scheduling ideas only |
| [mahrtayyab/tweety](https://github.com/mahrtayyab/tweety) | No LICENSE file | No grant, so no code |

## Adding to this file

If you adapt third-party code, do three things in the same change: keep the
upstream copyright and licence notice in the file you put it in, add a row to
the table above, and say in the pull request which upstream file it came from.
If you only took the idea, add a row to the second table instead. If the
upstream is copyleft, share-alike, or unlicensed, do not send the code at all.
